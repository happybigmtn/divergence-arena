### Strategy Effectiveness
- **Trust building phase (R1-3):** Accumulated 297.0 points through high-stake mutual cooperation with most opponents
- **Probe (R4):** Successfully identified exploitable opponents at low cost (stake 100)
- **Exploit/Adapt (R5):** 7 opponents were identified as exploitable, 2 correctly treated as retaliators
- The strategy's deceptive nature was most effective against unconditional cooperators (bot-001, bot-009, bot-010)
