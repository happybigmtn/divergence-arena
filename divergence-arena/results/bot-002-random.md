## BOT_RESULT

```
============================================================
BOT: bot-002-random
Strategy: Random uniform [1-100], Seed: 77
============================================================

Public Key: 4DGtFiVMHw8Yn5fKjCJnsnCPX2bn2Bdc6GxHVR4R8XQE

GUESSES (5 rounds, seeded PRNG with seed=77):
  Round 1: 39
  Round 2: 77
  Round 3: 37
  Round 4: 69
  Round 5: 49

SCORES: N/A (PROGRAM_ID and GAME_STATE_PUBKEY were template 
        variables {{PROGRAM_ID}} / {{GAME_STATE_PUBKEY}} that
        were not replaced with actual deployed program addresses)

FINAL RANK: Undetermined

STATUS: 
  ✅ Keypair generated and saved
  ❌ Airdrop failed (devnet faucet rate-limited 429)
  ❌ On-chain submission not possible (no program ID / no SOL)
  ✅ Guesses computed deterministically per strategy

NOTE: The Solana CLI binary had missing dynamic libraries 
      (libudev.so.1) and the devnet airdrop faucet was 
      rate-limited across all endpoints. The PROGRAM_ID and 
      GAME_STATE_PUBKEY environment variables contained 
      unreplaced template strings ({{PROGRAM_ID}}). All 5 
      random guesses were computed correctly using the seeded 
      LCG PRNG with seed 77.
